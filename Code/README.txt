The bill of materials demonstrates a well-balanced design in terms of cost, functionality, and integration. With a total cost of approximately £332, while achieving a comprehensive suite of robotic capabilities. Core components such as the Raspberry Pi 4B, lidar, camera module, and IMU provide strong computational and perception support for autonomous navigation and object recognition. The inclusion of waterproof servos, a gear pump, and gripper components further enhances the robot’s mechanical interaction with the environment, making it suitable for underwater tasks. The use of PETG and TPU filament materials allows for custom 3D printed structures, including fins, mounts, ensuring mechanical adaptability and ease of prototyping. Overall, the selected components are widely available, cost-effective, and compatible with ROS-based systems, making the design both technically feasible and economically efficient for experimental use.
